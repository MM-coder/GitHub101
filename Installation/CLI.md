# Linux

The Linux installation is platform-dependant, whereas you need to know your distribution and follow the instructions accordingly 

### Debian, Ubuntu Linux (apt)

Install:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**Note**: If you are behind a firewall, the connection to `keyserver.ubuntu.com` might fail. In that case, try running `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0`.

**Note**: If you get _"gpg: failed to start the dirmngr '/usr/bin/dirmngr': No such file or directory"_ error, try installing the `dirmngr` package. Run `sudo apt-get install dirmngr` and repeat the steps above.  

**Note**: most systems will have `apt-add-repository` already. If you get a _command not found_
error, try running `sudo apt install software-properties-common` and trying these steps again.
